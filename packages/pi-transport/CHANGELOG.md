# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `BoxFacts.bulk`: how large amounts of bytes move fastest into and out of a box, through the streams of `exec` or as files through `upload` and `download`; absent means files. `localBoxes` and `dockerBoxes` say `stream`.
- The movers (`./home`): `sealStore`, `checkpointStore` and `verifyStore` for a SQLite store, and `manifestOf`, `moveWorkspace` and `moveFile` for a workspace that travels between boxes as a `tar` stream, with a manifest taken in the box.
- The `Box` and `BoxProvider` interfaces, with `BoxError` codes.
- `localBoxes` (`./box/local`) and `dockerBoxes` (`./box/docker`).
- `registerBoxConformance` and `createBoxConformance` (`./testing`), 19 cases. The lifetime case takes an `ended` probe that looks at the machine and not at the provider.
- The strict `transport` config: `parseTransportConfig`, `TransportConfigSchema`, `parseDuration`.
- `boxEnv` (`./hands`): pi's `ExecutionEnv` over a `Box`, so a session's tools run in a box.
