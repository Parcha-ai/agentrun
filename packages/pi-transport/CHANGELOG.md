# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The `Box` and `BoxProvider` interfaces, with `BoxError` codes.
- `localBoxes` (`./box/local`) and `dockerBoxes` (`./box/docker`).
- `registerBoxConformance` and `createBoxConformance` (`./testing`), 19 cases. The lifetime case takes an `ended` probe that looks at the machine and not at the provider.
- The strict `transport` config: `parseTransportConfig`, `TransportConfigSchema`, `parseDuration`.
- `boxEnv` (`./hands`): pi's `ExecutionEnv` over a `Box`, so a session's tools run in a box.
- `transport()` (`./hands`): a Harness's `env` from a parsed config. Boxes are created at first use, found again
  after a restart, shared by the session or kept for each conversation, and let go with `release` or `destroy`.
  `HandsDoc`, `SessionBoxesDoc` and `TransportError` are exported from the package root.
- `boxEnv`'s `onLost` option: called once when the environment finds its box gone.
