# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `BoxFacts.bulk`: how large amounts of bytes move fastest into and out of a box, through the streams of `exec` or as files through `upload` and `download`; absent means files. `localBoxes` and `dockerBoxes` say `stream`.
- The movers (`./home`): `sealStore`, `checkpointStore` and `verifyStore` for a SQLite store, and `manifestOf`, `moveWorkspace` and `moveFile` for a workspace that travels between boxes as a `tar` stream, with a manifest taken in the box.
- Ownership (`./home`): `leaseIn`, `Ownership`, `ConditionalStore`, and `dirStore`, a store in a directory whose write is `link(2)` of a complete temp file; `registerStoreConformance` in `./testing`.
- The `Box` and `BoxProvider` interfaces, with `BoxError` codes.
- `localBoxes` (`./box/local`) and `dockerBoxes` (`./box/docker`).
- `registerBoxConformance` and `createBoxConformance` (`./testing`), 19 cases. The lifetime case takes an `ended` probe that looks at the machine and not at the provider.
- The strict `transport` config: `parseTransportConfig`, `TransportConfigSchema`, `parseDuration`.
- `boxEnv` (`./hands`): pi's `ExecutionEnv` over a `Box`, so a session's tools run in a box.
- `transport()` (`./hands`): a Harness's `env` from a parsed config. Boxes are created at first use, found again
  after a restart, shared by the session or kept for each conversation, and let go with `release` or `destroy`.
  `HandsDoc`, `SessionBoxesDoc` and `TransportError` are exported from the package root.
- `boxEnv`'s `onLost` option: called once when the environment finds its box gone.
- `modalBoxes` (`./box/modal`): a Modal sandbox (gVisor) or VM (`isolation: "vm"`) per box, over a Modal SDK the
  host passes in.
- Each provider is the entry `./box/<name>`, from one pattern export; `./box/box`, `./box/child` and `./box/files`
  are not entries.
- `daytonaBoxes` (`./box/daytona`): a Daytona sandbox per box over the REST API, sized by its snapshot; the key stays
  in the host.
