# @parcha/pi-agent-learn

An agent that learns in its own git repository. While it works, the agent notes what would help a later run with one
tool, `learn`, which costs nothing. The host proposes those notes on the run's branch, a curator merges the good ones to
`main`, and every later run reads them in a short `<learned>` section of its prompt, taken from the commit it was seeded
from. A bad lesson is undone with `git revert`, and history keeps it.

It builds on [`@parcha/pi-git-remote`](../pi-git-remote), which owns git, and on pi-durable, which owns the run. The
host owns git: no model tool commits or pushes, and the repository's `.git` is never in the agent's working directory.

This package is held: it is built and tested in this repository and not published yet. This release has the contract
the model sees and the host step that seeds a run. Proposing a run's notes, the guard every write goes through, curation
and workflow trials come next, on the types this release fixes (`Guard`, `Candidate`, `WorkflowHint`).

## Quickstart (no key, no network)

Node 22.19 or later and git 2.40 or later. In a checkout of this repository, run `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and
`npm run build -w @parcha/pi-agent-learn`, save this as `quickstart.mjs` at the repository root, and run
`node quickstart.mjs`. The model is pi-ai's scripted faux provider.

```js
import { execFileSync } from "node:child_process";
import { mkdtempSync } from "node:fs";
import { tmpdir } from "node:os";
import path from "node:path";
import { BACKGROUND_CONTEXT as ctx } from "@earendil-works/chord/context";

import { local, openRepo } from "@parcha/pi-git-remote";
import { agentLearn, collectCandidates, renderLearning, seedLearning } from "@parcha/pi-agent-learn";

// The agent's repository: its rules, and one learning as a curator would have merged it.
const root = mkdtempSync(path.join(tmpdir(), "acme-"));
const remoteDir = path.join(root, "acme.git");
execFileSync("git", ["init", "-q", "--bare", "--template=", "-b", "main", remoteDir]);

const main = await repo.commitTo("main", { files, message: "seed" });
await repo.push(main.sha, "main");

// One run: a pi-durable Harness with the learn extension and a model that notes a fact, then answers.
const faux = fauxProvider({ models: [{ id: "faux-1" }] });
faux.setResponses([
  (context) => {
    const system = context.messages.find((m) => m.role === "system");
    console.log(Object.values(system.sections ?? {}).find((s) => s.startsWith("<learned>")));
    return fauxAssistantMessage([fauxToolCall("learn", { type: "fact", text: "The state registry rate-limits at 1 request a second." }, { id: "call-1" })], { stopReason: "toolUse" });
  },
  (context) => fauxAssistantMessage([fauxText(`learn said ${context.messages.at(-1).content[0].text}`)], { stopReason: "stop" }),
]);
const models = createModels();
models.setProvider(faux.provider);
const registry = createRegistry();
registry.install(agentLearn());
const harness = await Harness.open(new MemoryStorage(), { models, registry }, ctx);

const seeded = await seedLearning({ repo, target: harness, into: path.join(root, "work") });
console.log("seeded from", seeded.sha === main.sha ? "main" : seeded.sha, "copied", seeded.files.join(", "));
const conversation = await harness.root(ctx, { agent: { model: { provider: "faux", modelId: "faux-1" }, instructions: "Research the company." } });
await (await conversation.submit({ type: "input", content: "Check Acme." }, ctx)).wait(ctx);
console.log("candidates:", JSON.stringify(await collectCandidates(harness)));
await harness.close(ctx);
```

## The repository

```
repo/
  agent.json                       rules tier: the agent definition; no learning writes it
  AGENTS.md                        rules tier: the standing rules; no learning writes it
  .agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md   skills
  .pi/agentrun/workflows/<name>/   saved workflows, in the DSL's own layout
  learnings/<id>.md                one learning per file
  inbox/<run id>.md                a run's candidates, on runs/<run id> only
  inbox/<run id>/workflows/<name>/ a workflow the run saved, the DSL's records byte for byte, on runs/<run id> only
  uses/<run id>.json               a run's workflow uses, on runs/<run id> only
```

`RULES_LOCKED` is the frozen list `["agent.json", "AGENTS.md"]`. `isRulesLocked(path)` is true for either name in any
segment of a path and in any spelling a file system or git could treat as the same file (case, Unicode compatibility
forms, ignorable characters, trailing dots or spaces, an NTFS stream suffix, an 8.3 short name). `assertNotRulesLocked`
throws for such a path; every writer calls it. `LAYOUT`, `tierOf`, `runBranch`, `inboxPath`, `usesPath`, `learningPath`
`inboxWorkflowDir`, `WORKFLOW_NAME` and `CAPS` fix the rest of the layout and its size caps.

A learning is one file: frontmatter, then the general rule.

```

```

`renderLearning` writes exactly this and `parseLearning` reads nothing looser: an unknown, missing or repeated key, or a
value out of shape, is a `LearnError` with code `format`. `learningId(runId, text)` is `L-` and 12 hex digits of SHA-256
over the run id and the text, so curating the same candidate twice cannot make two learnings.

## What the model sees

| Tool | Arguments | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `learn` | `{ type: "lesson" \| "fact" \| "correction" \| "used" \| "workflow", text, evidence?: string[], id?: string }` | `[noted <n>]` |

`learn` writes one candidate into the run's own pi-durable store (the session document `learn.candidates`), keyed by the
call id, inside the tool's commit. It is replay-safe: a call rerun after a crash finds its candidate and stores nothing
new. It makes no model call. A `used` mark names the learning that helped by its id. A `workflow` note names a workflow
the run saved (its name, by the DSL's rule: 1 to 64 lowercase letters, digits, dashes or underscores) and says in its
text when to use it; a correction, lesson or fact may name the learning it replaces. Text is at most 1,000 bytes and
evidence 1,000 bytes in all; a run makes at most 8 notes of every type but `used`, and 32 `used` marks. Evidence stays with the run and is
never part of a learning. `agentLearn({ guard, secrets })` checks every call with the host's guard first; a refused call
stores nothing and its result names the reason, never the value. The result carries its text under both `content` and
`output`, so pi-durable 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 all show it to the model.

The `<learned>` section says that the rules win, lists the active learnings at the seeded commit (most used first, the
first line of each), names the workflows to try for this input, and tells the agent when to call `learn`. It renders
from the run's `learn.seed` record, so it is the same on every request of a run and the same for every run seeded from
one commit. It holds at most 4,096 bytes: learnings that do not fit are not loaded, the section says how many, and their
ids are in the record. A learning whose first line holds the section's tag is never loaded. Without `learn` among the
agent's tools, the lines that ask it to call `learn` are left out.

## Host steps

```ts
const seeded = await seedLearning({ repo, ref: "main", target: harness, into: run.workspace, workflows });
const extension = agentLearn({ guard, secrets: () => vault.values() });
const candidates = await collectCandidates(harness);
```

`seedLearning` fetches, resolves `ref`, reads `learnings/*.md` at that commit, derives the index under the cap, records
`{ sha, index, omitted, workflows, copied }` in the run's store as `learn.seed`, and copies the active learnings to
`<into>/.agent/learnings/<id>.md` for the agent to read. Each copy is written into a staging directory the call creates
under `.agent/` and renamed over its name, so an interrupted copy never leaves a partial file there, and seeding again
restores the stored bytes over an edited copy or a link. A call removes only its own staging directory, so two seeds
into one directory at once both finish whole. Edits there are never committed. A file
that is misnamed, does not parse, is a symlink or is over 4 KB is skipped and named in `skipped`. A run is seeded once:
when its store already holds a seed, that commit is used again and the record is kept, so a restarted host never moves a
run to a newer commit. `readSeed` returns the record; `collectCandidates` returns the run's candidates in order.
`workflows` is a list of `{ name, status: "trial" | "active" }`, at most 8; it is empty until workflow trials land.

With [`@parcha/pi-durable-agent`](../pi-durable-agent), the run starts at the same commit: the host reads `agent.json` and
`.agents/skills/` at the sha with `repo.read` and `repo.list`, keeps the agent home on it (`createAgentHome(dir, {
definition, skills, sha })`, then `refreshAgentHome(home, { sha, from, definition, skills })` when main moves), starts the
run with `startRun(home, { host, sha })`, and seeds it with `seedLearning({ repo, ref: started.sha, target, into:
started.workspace })`. The runs index, `learn.seed` and the section then all name that sha.

Every failure is a `LearnError` with a `code`: `invalid`, `format`, `missing`, `rules_locked` or `too_large`.

## Versions

The pi-durable and chord peers accept 1.1 to 1.3.x. The suite runs on 1.1.0 in the workspace and on 1.2.0 and 1.3.0 in
the `pi-1-2` CI job, including a run killed with SIGKILL after `learn` committed and resumed from the same store.
