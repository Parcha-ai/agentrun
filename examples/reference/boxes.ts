// The boxes capability: a pi-transport `BoxProvider` the entry hands a demo (to its tools as `context.boxes`, and to the job's own tools through `boxEnv`), with the crossings
// and the transport box lines of the run built in. A demo never writes either.
//
// The crossings (a demo's `kills[].point` names them; `n` picks the nth time):
//   transport.box.create    a box is about to be made
//   transport.box.created   a box exists and is not yet used
//   transport.box.exec      a box command is in flight: started, its answer not yet read. The crossing the audit demo's install kill names
//   transport.box.destroy   a box is about to be destroyed
// A crossing taken inside a tool call (between its dispatch and the host keeping its answer) is never a `target: "run"` kill point: a kill there leaves that call
// unknown. It can still be a `target: "tool"` kill: the box taken in the crossing is destroyed once, the run's process lives, and no kill line is written.
//
// The transport lines (live lines, source `transport`): `box.created` { box, provider }, `box.killed` { box, crossing } (a planned loss, written before the box is
// destroyed), `box.ended` { box, provider, killed } (the box is gone, however it ended).
